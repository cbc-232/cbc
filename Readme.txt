Introduced Aya digital guide welcome line (default):
‚ÄúHiüëã, I‚Äôm Aya ‚Äî your digital guide from CyberBiz Clinic Ltd. I‚Äôm here to help you explore our services, products, and vision.‚Äù

Navigation & UX

Active state fix for nav on subpages; consistent highlighting across sections.

Deep link anchor for Board: #board uses an offset anchor to prevent overlap with fixed headers.

Performance

Single-load Swiper: eliminated duplicate inits and redundant script tags to prevent carousels from re-instantiating and causing jank.

Asset hygiene: removed unused CSS/JS; consolidated and minified bundles where applicable.

Images: batch-compressed; standardized use of WebP (including favicon.webp); ensured loading="lazy" where appropriate.

Defer/async: non-critical scripts moved to defer/async; long-running logic guarded behind DOMContentLoaded or idle callbacks where safe.

AOS usage: throttled animations and cautious delays to avoid layout thrash.

Accessibility

Landmark roles and semantic HTML verified on major templates.

Alt text pass for content images; focus styles improved; skip-to-content supported.

Color contrast checked against WCAG AA (spot fixes included).

SEO & Trust

Title/meta hygiene; Open Graph & basic Twitter Card tags added.

Canonical links and robots/sitemap expectations documented (see Build/Deploy).

Organization and product copy tuned to emphasize user benefit and social impact.

Company number and governance details surfaced for credibility.

Language & Terminology

Company name standardized to ‚ÄúCyberBiz Clinic Ltd.‚Äù across copy.

In customer-facing materials, the term ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù is preferred over ‚Äúpayment‚Äù (applies where relevant to public copy and invoices).

5) Front-End Notes (v0.3 Baseline)

Swiper

Ensure one initialization per carousel container.

Avoid multiple script includes; guard init behind DOMContentLoaded.

Destroy/re-init only on intentional breakpoint changes; otherwise persist.

AOS

Keep animations subtle and non-blocking.

Use limited delays (data-aos-delay) and consistent easing to prevent layout shift.

Images

Prefer WebP; retain fallbacks only where needed.

Apply loading="lazy" to non-critical images.

Keep aspect ratios consistent (CSS aspect-ratio or wrappers).

Scripts & Styles

Use defer for first-party JS that touches the DOM after parse; async for isolated third-party JS.

Consolidate and minify CSS/JS; purge unused selectors if a pipeline exists.

Anchors & Offset

For sections navigated via hash (e.g., #board), use an offset anchor (spacer or CSS scroll-margin-top) to account for fixed headers.

6) Accessibility Checklist (kept in CI/PR review)

Semantic structure: header, nav, main, footer, appropriate headings (one h1 per page).

All meaningful images include alt; decorative images use empty alt.

Keyboard navigation: visible focus, no keyboard traps, skip link present.

Color contrast ‚â• WCAG AA for text/icons.

Form labels and aria-* attributes where applicable.

7) SEO & Structured Data

Unique <title> + descriptive <meta name="description"> per page.

Open Graph: og:title, og:description, og:image (WebP + fallback if required), og:type, og:url.

Twitter Card: summary_large_image where useful.

Canonical URLs per page; robots.txt and sitemap.xml generated at deploy.

Organization/Product structured data (JSON-LD) can be added in future for richer snippets.

8) Security & Privacy

Policies live: Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Cookies.

Cookie banner/config present when tracking or third-party embeds exist.

Recommended (documented for infra):

Strict CSP (block inline except hashed/nonce‚Äôd as needed).

SRI on CDN scripts/styles.

HTTPS only with HSTS.

Minimal third-party scripts; audit quarterly.

9) Local Development

This project is a static site. You can open index.html directly or serve locally.

Option A ‚Äî Quick preview

# Using any static server you prefer:
npx serve .         # or
python -m http.server 8080


Option B ‚Äî With Node toolchain (if present in repo)

# Install
npm install

# Start dev server (if configured)
npm run dev

# Build/clean
npm run build
npm run clean

# Lint/format (if configured)
npm run lint
npm run format

10) Build & Deployment

Build output: static assets (HTML/CSS/JS/WebP).

Minification: CSS/JS minified; images pre-optimized.

Sitemaps/robots: generated or maintained at the root during deploy.

Cache strategy: long-cache hashed assets; HTML served no-cache (recommended).

CI hooks (if configured): run link check, HTML validation, and basic Lighthouse budget.

11) Content Principles (for future edits)

Voice: clear, forward-looking, user-benefit first.

Naming: always ‚ÄúCyberBiz Clinic Ltd.‚Äù

Impact focus: emphasize how our work unlocks value for individuals and communities (especially for LifeSync and CleanUp).

Product scope hygiene:

S.I.A (Cybersecurity, Intelligence & A.I) ‚Äî no automation claims.

S.A.A (agents/workflows/automations) ‚Äî automation lives here.

Timeline accuracy: 2022 (founder took office) ‚Üí 2023 (company formed) ‚Üí 2025 (incorporated).

12) Known Issues / Watch-List

A few legacy images may still need upscaling or re-cropping for consistent aspect ratios.

Continue monitoring Swiper instances on newly added pages to prevent re-init.

If new third-party widgets are added, re-evaluate CSP and performance budgets.

Validate contrast for any new brand colors or backgrounds.

13) Roadmap (v0.4 Targets)

Lighthouse targets: Perf ‚â• 90, SEO ‚â• 95, A11y ‚â• 95 on key pages.

JSON-LD for Organization and Products.

Expand Aya‚Äôs guided prompts and deep links into key sections.

i18n groundwork (content keys + copy extraction) if/when multilingual becomes a priority.

Replace any remaining raster icons with SVG; audit icon set for consistency.

Automated image pipeline (WebP/AVIF generation) integrated into builds.

14) Contributing

Use feature branches and concise PRs.

Keep changes atomic: content vs. layout vs. scripts.

Include screenshots (desktop + mobile) for visible changes.

Run local checks (lint/format, link validation) before opening PR.
